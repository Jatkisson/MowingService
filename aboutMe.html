            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is James Atkisson and I am a resident of the Santa Fe Hills neighborhood, located in the south side of Kansas City.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently an aspiring web developer/programmer but I am still in school and needing all the practice that I can get so I decided to put my practice to work and reach out to my local neighborhood for extra work outside of the technology industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have always been someone with multiple interests and I have had years of experience with lawn care and home care. Therefore, I will be offering my services to anyone in the local neighborhood that is in need.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I do have a busy schedule with work and school, I will still keep any appointment that I make.  You can count on me to keep my word, plus I don't charge until after the work has been completed, so you will know exactly what you are paying for.</p>
